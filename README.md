# A_Visualization_Makeover
For this mini-project, you are going to find a graphic that already exists, critique it, and recreate it using dimple.js or a software tool of your choice.

#Original Visualization

![](https://github.com/j450h1/A_Visualization_Makeover/blob/master/liberals.png)

This visualization comes from Canada's Liberal Party Website. The message is:

*Between 1981 and 2011, Canadaâ€™s Real GDP grew by 115%. At the same time the real median income of Canadian families only grew by 15%.*

However, Canada's Real GDP Chart's scale is exaggerated as it appears to be 150% growth vs the 15% median income growth. You can see that the Real GDP arrow goes up to the 3rd line (each line is approximately 45-50% since you can fit 3 of those smaller 15% arrows in it (15*3 = 45).
